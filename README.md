# verocol

Your own fashion ally

Start-off Date : 03/04/2025

A Nietzsche quote : ***“the good artist’s or thinker’s imagination is continually producing things good, mediocre, and bad, but his power of judgment, highly sharpened and practiced, rejects, selects, joins together”***

### **Problem Statement (According to Me):**

I’ve thought *a lot* about fashion — seriously, *a lot*! And one major problem I keep facing is the **repetitiveness** and **lack of personality** in my wardrobe.

Here’s the breakdown:

- I own multiple T-shirts, but most of them look almost identical — plain colors, mostly black.
- I don’t like printed T-shirts, so there's not much happening visually on what I wear.
- I usually invest in high-quality T-shirts, spending around $15–$20 each. They last me about a year and a half, which is great value.
- However, this also means my outfits often feel too simple or even boring over time.
- sometime choosing from online or retail store is just chaos for my brain too much options

**The real gap I feel:**

I want something that *preserves* the minimalist and clean look of my favorite T-shirts but also *adds style, personality, or even a message* — *without* needing to switch to printed tees or buy tons of clothes.

**That’s exactly where VeroCol comes in.**

VeroCol can act as that accessory — an add-on that elevates a simple T-shirt into something unique, expressive, and personal, while still staying true to the clean, minimalist style I love.

### **Starting-Off**

I'm feeling both incredibly excited and a little nervous as I kick off this new project. It’s a *fashion project* — if you can even call it just that — because it leans heavily into both design and tech, blending creativity with technical skills. That’s exactly why I believe I *can* (and *will*) bring it to life.

The project is called **VeroCol** (or **VC** for short). "Vero" stands for *true* and "Col" stands for *collar* — *True Collar* — not the phone app, haha.

The concept has been floating around in my head for about two months now, but after reading [christine8888.github.io](https://christine8888.github.io/) (linked in the references), I finally found the courage to take the first real step.

Right now, it’s still in the ideation phase — I haven’t even drawn the first draft yet — so realistically, it's going to take about a month to develop the first full version. After that, I'll gather feedback and iterate.

Throughout this journey, I plan to create multiple prototypes, learning and evolving at every step.

Let’s see where this adventure takes me.

**Let’s gooooooooooo! 🚀**

### Fashion Segment Challenges

## 1. Decision-Making Complexity and Choice Overload

**Problem:** Excessive similar options overwhelm consumers (paradox of choice) and fast-fashion’s planned obsolescence fuels impulsive, short-term purchases.

**Research:**

- [Can There Ever Be Too Many Options? A Meta-Analytic Review of Choice Overload](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/3/409/1827647) (Scheibehenne, Greifeneder & Todd, *Journal of Consumer Research*, 2010)
