A Nietzsche quote : **“*the good artist’s or thinker’s imagination is continually producing things good, mediocre, and bad, but his power of judgment, highly sharpened and practiced, rejects, selects, joins together”***

## Start:

![identity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41140b12-78ee-4daf-b4fe-fadc02409377)

I am very excited and worried at the same time while starting this project. It's a fashion project with a technical twist, combining both design and technology aspects. With my skillset, I believe I can make this a reality.

This project is called **VeroCol** (or **VC** for short), where "Vero" means true and "Col" stands for collar - hence "True Collar".

This concept has been developing in my mind for about 2 months. After reading [christine8888's blog](https://christine8888.github.io), I finally gathered the courage to take the first steps. The blog can be found in the references section.

The project is currently in the ideation phase, and I haven't created the first draft yet. I estimate it will take about a month to complete the initial version, after which I'll gather feedback and iterate on the design.

I plan to create multiple prototypes throughout this process to refine and improve the concept.

## Problem Statement

After much consideration about fashion, I've identified several challenges with my current wardrobe:

1. My T-shirts lack variety - most are plain colors (predominantly black)
2. I prefer plain T-shirts over printed ones, which limits styling options
3. I invest in quality T-shirts ($15-$20 range) that last about 1.5 years
4. Need for versatile accessories that can enhance style while maintaining minimalism - this is where VeroCol comes in

## Brand Philosophy

> "Company is nothing without its people, and a brand is the projection of the people and the culture that created it in the first place."

*- Personal philosophy*

So starting with this I got breakthrough in the identity design and its pretty simple actually, so here’s it …

## Brand Identity

- ROAME is designed to be simple and functional, offering an effortless clothing solution for introverts who prefer sustainable fashion
- Each individual's unique size and shape contributes to their personal style, represented by their **aura**
- The aura concept translates to a **model outline** in advertising and an **algorithmic personification** for customers
