# verocol

Your own fashion ally

Start-off Date : 03/04/2025

A Nietzsche quote : ***‚Äúthe good artist‚Äôs or thinker‚Äôs imagination is continually producing things good, mediocre, and bad, but his power of judgment, highly sharpened and practiced, rejects, selects, joins together‚Äù***

### **Problem Statement (According to Me):**

I‚Äôve thought *a lot* about fashion ‚Äî seriously, *a lot*! And one major problem I keep facing is the **repetitiveness** and **lack of personality** in my wardrobe.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

- I own multiple T-shirts, but most of them look almost identical ‚Äî plain colors, mostly black.
- I don‚Äôt like printed T-shirts, so there's not much happening visually on what I wear.
- I usually invest in high-quality T-shirts, spending around $15‚Äì$20 each. They last me about a year and a half, which is great value.
- However, this also means my outfits often feel too simple or even boring over time.
- sometime choosing from online or retail store is just chaos for my brain too much options

**The real gap I feel:**

I want something that *preserves* the minimalist and clean look of my favorite T-shirts but also *adds style, personality, or even a message* ‚Äî *without* needing to switch to printed tees or buy tons of clothes.

**That‚Äôs exactly where VeroCol comes in.**

VeroCol can act as that accessory ‚Äî an add-on that elevates a simple T-shirt into something unique, expressive, and personal, while still staying true to the clean, minimalist style I love.

### **Starting-Off**

I'm feeling both incredibly excited and a little nervous as I kick off this new project. It‚Äôs a *fashion project* ‚Äî if you can even call it just that ‚Äî because it leans heavily into both design and tech, blending creativity with technical skills. That‚Äôs exactly why I believe I *can* (and *will*) bring it to life.

The project is called **VeroCol** (or **VC** for short). "Vero" stands for *true* and "Col" stands for *collar* ‚Äî *True Collar* ‚Äî not the phone app, haha.

The concept has been floating around in my head for about two months now, but after reading [christine8888.github.io](https://christine8888.github.io/) (linked in the references), I finally found the courage to take the first real step.

Right now, it‚Äôs still in the ideation phase ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt even drawn the first draft yet ‚Äî so realistically, it's going to take about a month to develop the first full version. After that, I'll gather feedback and iterate.

Throughout this journey, I plan to create multiple prototypes, learning and evolving at every step.

Let‚Äôs see where this adventure takes me.

**Let‚Äôs gooooooooooo! üöÄ**

### Fashion Segment Challenges

## 1. Decision-Making Complexity and Choice Overload

**Problem:** Excessive similar options overwhelm consumers (paradox of choice) and fast-fashion‚Äôs planned obsolescence fuels impulsive, short-term purchases.

**Research:**

### How verocol could be useful

## 1. Decision-Making Complexity and Choice Overload

Verocol reduces choice paralysis by turning dozens of full-shirt options into one base tee plus a curated set of collars.

- **Option Reduction:** Research shows that modular garments‚Äîwhere users add or remove modules‚Äîcut down perceived choice overload in fashion contexts [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344924000892?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Cognitive Ease:** Meta-analysis confirms that fewer, well-defined choices improve satisfaction and lower decision time .
- **Flexible Commitment:** Minimal modules let consumers defer commitment until needed, countering fast-fashion‚Äôs impulse cycle [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923000413?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 2. Practical vs. Stylish Considerations

By separating function (base tee) from style (collar), Verocol optimizes both utility and aesthetics.

- **Enhanced Versatility:** Studies find that modular designs extend product lifetimes by facilitating upgrades and repairs, reducing fatigue over durability vs. style trade-offs [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624017086?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Targeted Performance:** Technical collar modules (e.g., moisture-wicking fabrics) add specific functions without forcing consumers to sacrifice comfort for fashion [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652618334565?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 3. Personal Style Uncertainty and Identity Exploration

Verocol empowers low-risk experimentation with different looks on the same garment.

- **Confidence Building:** Transformable apparel research highlights that switchable components let users trial styles affordably, boosting style certainty [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40691-019-0182-4.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Co-Creation Satisfaction:** Involving consumers in product customization raises perceived value and reduces regret [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278612513000526?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 4. Ethical Dilemmas and Consumption Conflicts

Modularity inherently supports circularity, making ethical choices easier and more aligned with values.

- **Waste Reduction:** Circular business models in fashion emphasize detachable components to minimize textile waste by replacing only worn modules [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772390922000130?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Service-Product Synergy:** Combining a base garment with modular collars fits product-service systems that extend use and cut guilt over unsustainable purchases [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666784322000158?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 5. Social and Cultural Considerations

Verocol‚Äôs modular collars allow adaptive conformity and respectful cultural expression.

- **Adaptive Norms:** Modular options help wearers align with social or event-specific dress codes, then revert to personal style [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378720621000355?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Culturally-Sensitive Modules:** Limited-edition collars by diverse designers enable respectful cultural signals without overcommitting to full-garment themes [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-024-10703-8?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 6. Structural Industry Problems

By decoupling design modules, Verocol opens its platform to under-represented designers and boosts transparency.

- **Inclusive Designer Access:** Modular systems lower barriers for emerging talent to contribute discrete collar designs instead of entire collections [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2199853124000246?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
- **Clear Impact Labels:** Each collar can carry its own sustainability and supply-chain metadata, addressing the information gap on environmental and social footprints [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2199853124002518?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Identity

### verocol - A true collar for your true self

- ***‚ÄúCompany is nothing without it‚Äôs people and a brand is the projection of the people and the culture that created it in the first place‚Äù***

   ***>** **You can quote me on this one BTW..***

So starting with this I got a breakthrough in the identity design and its pretty simple actually, so here‚Äôs it ‚Ä¶

- verocol is the brand that is simple and functional and for people like me verocol should give us an easy optout from the decisions of choosing cloths and also do it sustainably that's it
- now the size and shape are unique to each individual as they are to themselves and to combine them in some way it can only possible through their mind and hence the brand asset need to show that mind and uniqueness hence it should be the **aura** of the person
- now in functional and practical way you can describe aura as the **model outline** (in advertising things) or as an **algorithmic personification** (for customers).
- also for the mark to define and differentiate the brand itself it simply the v for verocol aligned with collar shape round neck and the one-line art to define personality of user
