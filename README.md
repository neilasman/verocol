## Introduction

![identity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41140b12-78ee-4daf-b4fe-fadc02409377)

I am very excited and worried at the same time while starting this project. It's a fashion project with a technical twist, combining both design and technology aspects. With my skillset, I believe I can make this a reality.

This project is called **VeroCol** (or **VC** for short), where "Vero" means true and "Col" stands for collar - hence "True Collar".

This concept has been developing in my mind for about 2 months. After reading [christine8888's blog](https://christine8888.github.io), I finally gathered the courage to take the first steps. The blog can be found in the references section.

The project is currently in the ideation phase, and I haven't created the first draft yet. I estimate it will take about a month to complete the initial version, after which I'll gather feedback and iterate on the design.

I plan to create multiple prototypes throughout this process to refine and improve the concept.

## Problem Statement

After much consideration about fashion, I've identified several challenges with my current wardrobe:

1. My T-shirts lack variety - most are plain colors (predominantly black)
2. I prefer plain T-shirts over printed ones, which limits styling options
3. I invest in quality T-shirts ($15-$20 range) that last about 1.5 years
4. Need for versatile accessories that can enhance style while maintaining minimalism - this is where VeroCol comes in

## Brand Philosophy

> "Company is nothing without its people, and a brand is the projection of the people and the culture that created it in the first place."

*- Personal philosophy*

Starting with this philosophy, I achieved a breakthrough in the identity design. It's quite simple, yet effective:

## Brand Identity

- ROAME is designed to be simple and functional, offering an effortless clothing solution for introverts who prefer sustainable fashion
- Each individual's unique size and shape contributes to their personal style, represented by their **aura**
- The aura concept translates to a **model outline** in advertising and an **algorithmic personification** for customers

# The Main Problems in Choosing Fashion: A Comprehensive Analysis

In today’s complex fashion landscape, consumers face numerous challenges when selecting clothing items. Recent research indicates that a significant majority of individuals experience difficulties in making fashion choices, with various factors contributing to this widespread phenomenon. This report explores the multifaceted problems in fashion selection, examining psychological, practical, ethical, and societal dimensions that impact consumer decision-making processes.

## Decision-Making Complexity and Choice Overload

The modern fashion consumer faces an overwhelming array of options that complicates the selection process. According to a recent StyleBuddy survey, seven out of ten people admit to having difficulties deciding what clothes to buy, highlighting a common dilemma affecting consumers across various demographics[1](about:blank#fn1). This decision paralysis stems from several interconnected factors that create a burdensome shopping experience.

### Overwhelming Options and Trend Velocity

One primary challenge in fashion selection is navigating the excessive number of choices available both in physical stores and online platforms. With fashion trends evolving at unprecedented rates, consumers struggle to keep pace with changing styles while making informed purchasing decisions[2](about:blank#fn2). The constant introduction of new designs creates pressure to stay current, leaving many shoppers uncertain about which items merit investment. Additionally, the fear of selecting items that will quickly become outdated further complicates the decision-making process, often resulting in hesitation or complete avoidance of purchases[3](about:blank#fn3).

### Practical vs. Stylish Considerations

Consumers frequently encounter tension between selecting clothing that fulfills practical needs versus items that align with current style preferences. This balancing act requires evaluating multiple factors simultaneously, including functionality, durability, versatility, and aesthetic appeal[4](about:blank#fn4). The pressure to make optimized choices that satisfy both practical requirements and style aspirations creates cognitive burden, particularly when fashion marketing emphasizes the importance of appearance over utility. This dilemma often leads to decision fatigue and extended deliberation that prolongs the shopping process.

## Personal Style Uncertainty and Identity Concerns

Fashion choices are intrinsically connected to personal identity expression, creating significant psychological challenges for many consumers when selecting clothing items.

### Lack of Style Confidence

Many individuals experience profound uncertainty about their personal style preferences, which severely impacts their ability to make confident fashion selections. This uncertainty manifests as difficulty identifying which garments complement their body type, coloring, or overall aesthetic[5](about:blank#fn5). Without a clear understanding of their personal style, consumers often make inconsistent choices or rely heavily on external validation, leading to wardrobe incoherence and dissatisfaction with purchases.

### Identity Expression and Social Perception

Fashion serves as a powerful medium for self-expression and identity communication, making clothing selection a psychologically complex process. Consumers must navigate how their fashion choices reflect and shape both individual and collective identities[6](about:blank#fn6). This complexity creates anxiety about how one’s appearance will be perceived by others and whether clothing choices accurately represent one’s self-concept. The pressure to align fashion selections with personal identity while remaining socially acceptable creates significant psychological burden during the selection process.

### Body Image Concerns

The pursuit of certain fashion ideals can trigger or exacerbate body image issues, particularly among young consumers[7](about:blank#fn7). When shopping for clothing, individuals often confront discrepancies between their actual body and idealized fashion representations, creating discomfort during the selection process. These body image concerns can significantly restrict perceived options and lead to negative emotional experiences during shopping, further complicating clothing selection decisions.

## Ethical Dilemmas and Consumption Conflicts

Modern consumers increasingly face moral conflicts when making fashion choices, creating additional layers of complexity in the selection process.

### The Attitude-Behavior Gap

A significant challenge in fashion selection involves reconciling ethical intentions with actual consumption behavior. Research identifies an “attitude-behavior gap” or “ethical consumption paradox” where consumers struggle to translate their moral concerns into purchasing decisions[8](about:blank#fn8). This discrepancy is particularly evident among “flexible consumers” who oscillate between ethical choices (like secondhand shopping) and conventional fast fashion purchases, creating internal conflict during the selection process[9](about:blank#fn9).

### Economic and Institutional Barriers

Economic factors frequently obstruct consumers’ ability to align fashion choices with ethical values. Price considerations often outweigh ethical intentions, particularly regarding sustainable or ethically produced fashion alternatives[10](about:blank#fn10). Additionally, institutional factors such as limited availability of ethical options, lack of transparency in production methods, and inadequate information about ethical alternatives create significant barriers to value-aligned selection processes[11](about:blank#fn11).

### Post-Purchase Conflict

Research indicates that consumers who fail to translate ethical intentions into purchasing behavior often experience significant post-purchase conflict, manifesting as feelings of guilt or regret[12](about:blank#fn12). This anticipated emotional response adds another layer of complexity to the selection process, as consumers must weigh potential future feelings against immediate desires. The study by Bröcher found that many consumers cope by developing “future intentions” - promising themselves to make more ethical choices in subsequent purchases, which creates a cycle of intention-behavior discrepancy[13](about:blank#fn13).

## Social and Cultural Considerations

Fashion choices exist within broader social and cultural contexts that create additional selection challenges for consumers.

### Social Pressure and Conformity

Consumers frequently experience pressure to conform to specific fashion trends or group norms, potentially compromising individual preferences[14](about:blank#fn14). This tension between personal expression and social acceptance creates decision conflict during the selection process. The fear of negative judgment or social exclusion based on clothing choices can substantially restrict perceived options and lead to selections that prioritize conformity over authentic self-expression[15](about:blank#fn15).

### Cultural Sensitivity Concerns

Growing awareness of cultural appropriation has introduced new complexities into fashion selection. Consumers must navigate concerns about whether certain styles might appropriate elements from other cultures without appropriate understanding or respect[16](about:blank#fn16). This consideration adds an additional layer of evaluation during the selection process, particularly for fashion-forward consumers seeking distinctive styles while remaining culturally sensitive and respectful.

## Structural Industry Problems

Beyond individual decision-making challenges, the fashion industry’s structure creates systemic barriers to satisfying selection experiences.

### Limited Diversity in Design

The lack of diversity among fashion designers significantly impacts available options for consumers. Research indicates that homogeneity in the design industry leads to limited perspectives and representation in fashion offerings[17](about:blank#fn17). This restriction creates particular challenges for consumers from underrepresented groups who struggle to find clothing that addresses their specific needs, preferences, and cultural contexts. The resulting market gaps further complicate the selection process for many demographic segments[18](about:blank#fn18).

### Sustainability and Ethical Production Considerations

The environmental impact of fashion production introduces additional complexity into consumer selection processes. As awareness of sustainability issues grows, consumers must evaluate not only a garment’s style and fit but also its environmental footprint and ethical production methods[19](about:blank#fn19). This multilayered assessment requires significant knowledge and information that many consumers lack, creating uncertainty and indecision during the selection process.

## Conclusion

The process of selecting fashion items involves navigating a complex landscape of personal, social, ethical, and practical considerations that create significant challenges for consumers. The documented difficulties in fashion selection stem from interconnected factors including decision overload, personal style uncertainty, ethical dilemmas, social pressures, and structural industry limitations. These multifaceted challenges explain why research consistently shows high levels of consumer difficulty in clothing selection processes.

Addressing these challenges requires multilevel interventions, including better consumer education about personal style development, improved access to ethical fashion alternatives, greater diversity within the fashion industry, and enhanced decision support tools for navigating available options. Until such interventions are widely implemented, consumers will likely continue experiencing significant difficulties in making satisfying and confident fashion choices that align with their values, identity, and practical needs.
